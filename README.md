# Employee Burnout Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Employee Burnout Analysis Dashboard is a data-driven tool designed to help organizations monitor and mitigate employee burnout by providing actionable insights into key factors affecting employee well-being. This interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes critical metrics such as burnout levels, average burn rates, mental fatigue scores, and the impact of work-from-home setups.

The goal of this project is to empower HR teams and leadership with real-time analytics, enabling data-driven decision-making to improve employee satisfaction and productivity.

## Features
### 1. Burnout Level Breakdown:
Visual representation of employee burnout categorized as High, Medium, and Low.

### 2. Key Metrics:
Total employees analyzed: 23,000.
Average burnout rate: 0.45.
High burnout population: 4,809 employees.
### 3. Work-From-Home (WFH) Analysis:
Comparison of burnout rates and mental fatigue between employees with and without WFH setups.
Insight into the prevalence of WFH setups: 54% adoption.
### 4. Trends Over Time:
Monthly analysis of average burn rates with trends identified for potential burnout periods (e.g., spikes in March and June).
### 5. Interactive Filters:
Dynamic filtering by gender, burnout level, company type, and date of joining for deep dives into subsets of data.
